## Rating hateful term uses in context - Annotation guidelines

<br />

### TASK
In this study you will see sentences that mention a particular term together with the definition of that term, like the following:

|||
|-|-|
|_example_|The **buggerâ€™s** given me the wrong change.|
|_term_|bugger|
|_definition_ &nbsp;&nbsp;|A foolish or worthless person or thing; a despicable person.|

<br />
In this case, the example is a sentence in which the term "bugger" is used and the definition describes the meaning of the term "bugger", which is taken from a dictionary source. The term can be a noun, like "bugger", but it can also be an adjective, verb etc.. The example sentences can come from different sources (e.g. social media, news, literature) and in different English dialects (e.g. US, UK or Australian English).
<br /><br />

Your task is to judge to what extent the target term expresses hate towards a person or group within the specific example sentence. E.g. how hateful is the term "bugger" when it is used in the example sentence: "The bugger's given me the wrong change."? You can choose one of the following labels:

|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|*1  Not hateful*&nbsp;&nbsp;|*2  Weakly hateful*&nbsp;&nbsp;|*3  Strongly hateful*&nbsp;&nbsp;|*4  Cannot decide*|

<br />

The definition of a term's meaning is given to help you understand the use of the term. The definition can already indicate that the term can be used for offending someone, like "A foolish or worthless person or thing; a despicable person." as the definition for the term "bugger". Still, your task is to judge the use of the term <ins>within the specific example sentence</ins>. In the example above, one could indeed judge that "bugger" is used by the speaker to express hate against the person that "has given the wrong change".

Note here that this judgement is always <ins>subjective</ins>, i.e. the rating depends on your own opinion and there are no right or wrong labels. If you can not make a judgment given both the sentence and the sense definition, e.g. the sentence is too poorly written and/or the sense definition is not providing (enough) information about its hatefulness, please indicate this with "Cannot decide" label. 
<br />

### MORE SPECIFIC

As mentioned, it is important in this study that you rate <ins>the specific use of a target term</ins>, rather than the given definition. Although the definition can already suggest a hateful connotation, some ways of using the term, e.g. in a playful way or without referring to a particular person or group, don't need to be hateful. In the following example, the term "commafucker" is used and the given definition "A person who is pedantic about grammar" implicates that the word is likely used to insult someone. However, in the example sentence below, that starts with "As a colleague commafucker [...]", the speaker identifies him or herself with the term and therefore does not use it to express hate against someone.

|||
|-|-|
|_example_|As a colleague **commafucker** though I would say that it's often better to restrain yourself :-)|
|_term_|commafucker|
|_definition_&nbsp;&nbsp;|A person who is pedantic about grammar.|

<br />
This is in constrast with the example below, for which one could judge that the term "commafucker" is used to express hate against the "beings hanging around here", which is more in line with the connotation of the given definition of the term.
<br /><br />

|||
|-|-|
|_example_|There are far worse beings hanging around here, **commafuckers** whose souls are like dark paperclips - not a glint of hope for salvation.|
|_term_|commafucker|
|_definition_&nbsp;&nbsp;|A person who is pedantic about grammar.|

<br />
You should base your hatefulness rating on the example sentence but be careful to focus on the meaning of the term and <ins>not the general meaning of the example sentence</ins>. A sentence can convey hate but the target term is not necessarily contributing to this. The example below illustrates this:
<br /><br />

|||
|-|-|
|_example_|ELIAS: **Police** up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks.|
|_term_|police|
|_definition_ &nbsp;&nbsp;|To clean up an area.|

<br />
The sentence can be judged as conveying hate towards the target group here named as "dinks". However, the target term "police" is a verb used in this sentence to describe the act of cleaning up, which is not offending someone and thus does not carry a hateful meaning.
